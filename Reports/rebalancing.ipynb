After rebalancing, the depth of the tree was reduced to 10, which greatly improved the performance of the binary search operations, reducing the time it took to perform 5000 lookups from 2.538141 ms to 0.390513 ms.\n",

After rebalancing, the depth of the tree was reduced to 8, and the time it took to perform 5000 lookups was reduced from 0.520248 ms to 0.244970 ms.\n",

The program performs another 5000 lookups on the rebalanced tree, which now takes only 0.340277 ms, and reports the checksum of the dataset again. The program also confirms that the checksum is correct.\n",

It shows that the program took a total of 2.721414108 seconds to execute, during which time the CPU was utilized 99.9% of the time. It also shows information about the number of cycles, instructions, branches, and branch-misses."
