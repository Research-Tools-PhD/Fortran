This suggests that the hash table implementation is significantly faster at searching for values in the data provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the performance counter stats, we can see that the hash table implementation utilized the CPU slightly more efficiently than the linked list implementation, with a slightly higher instructions per cycle rate (4.23 vs 1.75) and a higher rate of branches per second (5.497 G/sec vs 2.058 G/sec). The hash table implementation also had fewer branch misses as a percentage of all branches (0.22% vs 0.10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the provided performance data, the hash table implementation is faster than both the array and linked list implementations in terms of task-clock time, cycles executed, and branch misprediction rate. The hash table implementation took the least amount of time for both the array value and hash table lookups, with the array implementation coming in second, and the linked list implementation taking the longest. \n",
